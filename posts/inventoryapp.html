If I had to describe my software development journey in a single witticism,
    “learning new techniques and technologies in uncomfortably short time frames,”
    would do the trick nicely.
Nowhere was this more true than during a course I took on mobile development.
The course itself was short enough from the outset—unlike most colleges,
    SNHU's online program consisted of a relentless series of 8-week terms,
    48 weeks per year—but I managed to compress this timeline even further.
</p>

<p>
The task was fairly straightforward:
    build an inventory tracking app for Android
    with rudimentary user login functionality
    and a simple grid-based inventory management interface.
While this was my first exposure to Android development,
    the coursework and textbook were written with Java in mind;
    I'd written a fair amount of Java in previous courses,
    and I assumed I'd take the path of least resistance
    and write this app in Java, as well.
Once I started development on the actual application logic, however,
    it became abundantly clear that Java was not the path of least resistance.
In the time since the course material had been written,
    Android development had taken a hard turn towards Kotlin,
    a language with sophisticated features
    for handling the complexities of modern application development.
I soldiered on for a week or two,
    convinced that I could make things work,
    but progress was slow,
    and the promise of Kotlin lurked just out of reach,
    sequestered behind the gate of learning an entirely new language.

The straw that finally broke my back was asynchronous programming;
    I'd used it in Python for a previous project,
    and I knew it was the best way to approach a particular task,
    but Java's approach to the technique—at least at the time—was arcane,
    built out in third-party libraries
    that would introduce a whole new layer of unnecessary complexity.
In a moment of desperation,
    I pulled up the Kotlin language documentation,
    and there it was.
Asynchronous programming was built-in,
    a fundamental paradigm around which the language had planned from the start.
That was the solution, then!
I just had to learn this new language
    and use it to write an entire application&#x2026;
In two weeks.

It seemed like an impossible task,
    but I knew I'd be a better developer for it,
    so I hunkered down,
    put my nose to the grindstone,
    and wrote InventoryApp,
    <a href="https://github.com/seangllghr/portfolio-inventoryapp">preserved here</a> in exactly<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup> the state it was in
    at the end of that two-week sprint.
It's not cleverly named,
    and it's not going to win any awards for visual design,
    but it's a perfectly viable prototype
    that stands as a testament to my ability to hit the ground running.
That may not be the only skill a developer needs,
    but it might be the hardest to acquire,
    and it's one I've gotten a lot of opportunities to practice.
