The original STOCKS server — a
    fairly pedestrian Node.js/Express/MongoDB application
    presenting a simplistic REST API — was
    the clear first step
    in the process of enhancing the application for my portfolio.
The new STOCKS server would have to tailor this generic API
    to meet the needs of the nascent web client
    in a sustainable and extensible fashion,
    and it would do so with several clear goals in mind.
Most importantly,
    the new server and its concurrent data model
    would need to ensure the stability and security of the overall system.
The original application enforced only basic constraints on input data,
    an approach that was suitable
    for a first foray into RESTful web services,
    but one that was certain to expose the system to all manner of calamity
    as ongoing development piled on
    the additional complexity of a real front-end application.
Furthermore,
    the server should aim to implement the best of modern application design,
    to ease developer burden
    and further improve performance, maintainability, and capability.

<p>
This last point was especially salient in this early stage of the project.
Despite my vantage point at the very beginning of my career,
    I understood how rare it was to have the chance
    to approach a problem with both an entirely clean slate
    and the benefit of lessons learned from a first attempt.
After examining a number of solutions
    for managing the complexity of a full-stack application,
    I decided to implement the project as a monorepo,
    and selected <a href="https://nrwl.io/">Nrwl Nx</a> to manage the workspace.
The term <i>monorepo</i> refers to a single repository
    which contains code for multiple loosely-coupled projects,
    from a single full-stack solution like our STOCKS application
    to the entire development output of a company.
</p>

<p>
Nx was definitely overkill,
    but it promised to handle integration
    of multiple independent applications and libraries
    across a single project workspace,
    an approach I ultimately couldn't pass up.
On top of making sure I was able to wire all of the pieces together,
    Nx also came with batteries included;
    it went about scaffolding applications and modules without complaint,
    happily launched whichever development servers I needed,
    and I swear I could hear it whistling cheerfully as it set up my Git repo.
More importantly — for me, a die-hard command-line enthusiast — it
    offered all of this functionality <i>without</i> a lumbering IDE.
Nx's most significant contribution to the project was here,
    in streamlining the developer experience.
While I don't doubt that I could've reached a point
    where I was as confident manipulating the relevant pieces as it was,
    the tool's ability to fast-track the process of onboarding — even
    into a codebase <i>I</i> was responsible for — was invaluable,
    and a testament to its utility in the real world.
</p>

<p>
With the choice of workspace management out of the way,
    the next major hurdle to clear involved frameworks.
Specifically,
    I had to decide whether to reimplement STOCKS using pure Express
    or delve further into the unknown
    and pick a Typescript-native library.
Ever the adventurer — or masochist — I chose to dive into the unknown,
    and went about assembling a Nest.js application.
Nest.js is a Typescript back-end web framework
    that aims to be library-agnostic.
It uses Express by default,
    but is equally prepared to use other frameworks,
    if something else strikes your fancy.
Nest prides itself on being simple and declarative,
    using decorators and dependency injection
    to limit the amount of boilerplate code its developers have to write,
    in the same vein as Angular.
Since I was going to be using Angular later in the project,
    I thought it might be prudent to give the paradigm a try
    while I was still working with familiar concepts.
</p>

<p>
I'm glad I did.
Nest.js made the process of working on a REST API astonishingly simple.
Two directories worth of routes and controllers
    simplified into one <code>[module-name].controller.ts</code> file per module.
The concept of modules itself
    wasn't even especially difficult to wrap my head around,
    as they mapped directly to the nested routes files
    that I had written for the original STOCKS server
    (at least, they did for this phase of the project).
More impressively,
    I could inject the <code>MongooseModule</code>
    and abstract away the entire data access layer
    with a single <code>async</code> method call.
It was the picture of a modern, productive work environment,
    and it led me directly to the solution to the other,
    far more significant goal of this enhancement.

<h3 id="org110bbe6">Defining the Data Model</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org110bbe6">
<p>
Once I got into the meat of developing the new STOCKS application,
    it quickly became clear
    that Nest.js wasn't just going to make it easier to define a data model,
    it was going to force me to do so.
For Mongoose to do its work,
    it needs a <code>Schema</code>,
    which — by certainly-random happenstance — sounded
    an awful lot like the data model I'd set out to design.
As it turned out
    (again, certainly through serendipitous good fortune,
    and definitely not as a result of deliberate intent
    precipitated by arduous research and careful consideration<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>),
    Typescript and Nx provided a spectacular avenue
    for defining that data model in a powerful, reusable manner.
Using an Nx library — which
    is ultimately just some smoke and mirrors
    wrapped around the Typescript compiler's path handling capabilities — I
    was able to define a set of interfaces for objects that contained stock data.
These interfaces were deceptively simple,
    as they contained only declarations of the names and data types
    of the data a stock was expected to contain,
    but they provided all of the leverage necessary
    to enforce consistency across the entire application.
While I would eventually implement a separate <code>Stock</code> class
    (which, itself, implemented the <code>StockData</code> interface,
    as it came to be called)
    that offered some additional functionality,
    the interface itself remained essentially similar throughout the project.
In fact, the data model interface experienced only two major changes
    during the duration of development,
    only one of which broke previously-implemented functionality.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgbd04939">
<p>
The decisions I made during this first phase of development
    had lasting ramifications for the project.
I implemented a modular, extensible RESTful application server
    using a host of modern programming techniques.
This modularity was crucial;
    I ended up extending the API several times
    as my needs changed and clarified
    during development of the <code>market-sync</code> module and the WebSTOCKS client,
    and each extension took only a few minutes to implement.
Each comparable extension in pure Express
    would likely have taken twice as long
    and required substantially more code to execute.
</p>

<p>
These advantages were compounded
    by the flexibility of the data model and its pairing with Mongoose.
Because the Mongoose model saved only the data
    which was explicitly included in the schema — which,
    itself, implemented the <code>StockData</code> interface to the letter — I
    was able to bypass hours of development time
    that I might have otherwise spent writing code
    to parse incoming data and transform it to conform with the model.
In addition to the stability and security improvements
    that this robust data processing model engenders,
    development on subsequent phases was considerably accelerated.
Furthermore,
    the data model can continue to grow seamlessly
    as more data becomes necessary;
    simply adding fields to the interface and schema files
    is enough to extend the application.
This kind of extensibility is unequivocally valuable,
    as it eases application maintenance
    and facilitates agile response to changing user demands.
