<p>
This might have been one of my favorite projects,
    though I'll concede the name is not one of my finer marketing choices.
We were tasked with developing the software
    to drive a prototype weather monitoring system<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>
While the components and libraries were off-the-shelf,
    the project makes heavy use of modern techniques,
    including Python's <code>asyncio</code> library for asynchronous programming.
It monitors and records temperature and relative humidity during daylight hours,
    updating at a user-defined interval,
    and displays the current time, last reading, and dashboard server status
    to the included LCD screen.
The screen's backlight also changes color
    to indicate current conditions at a glance,
    and the LED bar on the left gives a rough temperature indication.

</figure>

<p>
The application additionally includes a web dashboard,
    which provides rudimentary administrative facilities
    and allows the user to visualize trends in the collected weather data.
The dashboard front end runs on a simple Express back end server,
    and is served from the Raspberry Pi device itself.
Charting functionality uses Canvas.js,
    with custom logic for inserting chart breaks
    to compress large gaps in the dataset,
    such as those that occur when the system is in standby at night.

<div class="footdef"><sup><a id="fn.1" class="footnum" href="#fnr.1">1</a></sup> <div class="footpara">I also had to do a little "design and assembly",
    in that I had to pick components,
    plug in wires,
    and strap everything down
    so that the device could survive eight weeks with cats.
    However, there was no custom design or fabrication work,
    so it hardly seems fair to call it hardware engineering.</div></div>
