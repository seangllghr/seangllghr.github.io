<p>
With the initial reimplementation of the core server application completed,
    development on meaningful expansions
    to the application's capabilities could begin.
Since the application database was still nearly empty,
    starting work on front-end development didn't seem to make much sense,
    so focus shifted to expanding the server application
    with what would become the <code>market-sync</code> module.
In writing the original proposal for the module — which
was to implement a REST client service
    that would synchronize the STOCKS application's internal database
    with the relevant subset of real-world market data
    obtained from a third-party API — I
    thinking that it would likely constitute the smallest enhancement
    by raw contribution to the codebase,
    but its effect on the overall utility of the application
    would dwarf that of other modules.
In retrospect,
    the capabilities introduced in <code>market-sync</code>
    quickly came to define the application as a whole
    as development progressed through the final two phases of the project.

<p>
Stock market data changes at a blistering pace,
    with some APIs offering real-time trade data
    that updates several times per second.
Of course, such a volume of data doesn't come cheap,
    and real-time API access was well outside
    what I could reasonably justify paying.
After some research,
    I selected <a href="https://alphavantage.co/">AlphaVantage</a> as the third-party provider
    and registered for their free tier of service.
This restricted me to a limit of 5 API calls per minute
    and a daily limit of 500 total calls.
Equally problematic was the fact that I'd configured the application
    to take advantage of MongoDB Atlas at its free tier.
Atlas is a cloud database service
    offered by the company that develops the MongoDB software,
    which handles database setup
    and configuration of features like sharding and authentication.
They offer a free tier of service for experimentation and study,
    but it comes with a restrictive 512MB limit on database size.
</p>

<p>
Between these two constraints,
    it quickly became clear that updating any substantial database of stocks
    would be an exercise in careful coordination.
To limit both database size and update frequency,
    I chose to pull daily time series data from AlphaVantage's API,
    which seemed like a good compromise
    between ensuring that data was fairly current
    and respecting the limitations of the free services I depended on.
Examining the API documentation
    revealed another potential snag in the update process:
    in order to conform to the data model
    developed in the first phase of development
    and provide actionable market data
    for the analysts who might eventually use the application,
    the <code>market-sync</code> service would need to aggregate data
    from two separate API calls.

<p>
Despite the fact that the <code>market-sync</code> service
    began its life as a database-focused enhancement,
    managing the constraints imposed by the third-party provider
    called for an approach rooted in concepts of Data Structures and Algorithms.
The first step was to atomize update operations;
    I defined an update object interface that could enforce a known structure
    on objects containing information about upcoming updates,
    as well as an update type <code>enum</code>
    to reliably indicate which update function to execute
    within a narrow, predefined set.
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<label class="org-src-name"><span class="listing-number">Listing 1: </span>The <code>UpdateObject</code> and its related <code>UpdateType</code> <code>enum</code>.</label><pre class="src src-typescript" id="orgee86942">enum UpdateType {
  OVERVIEW = 1,
  TIME_SERIES,
  DEFER,
}

interface UpdateObject {
  updateType: UpdateType;
  symbol: string;
}
</pre>
</div>

<p>
With these structures established,
    I implemented a simple queue to track pending update operations
    using direct calls to Javascript array methods.
Since this was the only instance of queuing in the application,
    I didn't go through the extra effort
    of implementing a fully-formed <code>Queue</code> type
    or pulling in another dependency
    for one written by another developer.
Regardless,
    the result was an effective queue for <code>UpdateObjects</code>.
All that remained was to schedule a recurring task
    that would run each successive update
    with an appropriate gap between each.
There were a number of potential solutions to this scheduling problem,
    but, once again, Nest.js provided a solution
    that quickly became the clear front-runner.
Nest's scheduling module,
    which relies on a pure Javascript implementation of UNIX/Linux's <code>cron</code>,
    provided a familiar interface to task scheduling,
    particularly for a Linux enthusiast like myself.
Soon,
    the application was running an update every 12 seconds,
    making short work of the update queue — and,
    once I started repopulating the update queue when it emptied,
    rapidly consuming my 500-call-per-day limit.
Another <code>cron</code> job quickly sorted this problem out,
    scheduling an update for a reasonable post-market time each night.
</p>

<p>
The final challenge with maintaining a low-limit system
    was fundamentally a development concern,
    rather than one that would crop up in production,
    but it proved to be one of the more intractable issues to nail down.
Each time the server started,
    the system would queue a time series update
    for each stock in the database.
During development, this could happen dozens of times in an hour,
    let alone over the course of a work day.
Since there is no advantage to refreshing daily data more than once per day,
    the simple solution was to update only at the specified time.
However, this was also sub-optimal,
    since there was no guarantee that the development system
    would be online at 01:00 UTC,
    the specified update time.
Ultimately, the ideal solution was to examine the timestamp of each stock
    and update only if the stock had not updated since the last market close.

With the completion of the market sync service,
    development of the STOCKS application stood poised to progress
    into the third and final phase of development,
    and it would do so buoyed by the strengths of a robust back end.
The core API, data model, and <code>market-sync</code> services
    would all have a chance to prove their flexibility and extensibility,
    as each grew and changed during this final phase
    to accommodate the excesses of the front-end developer<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>.
The <code>market-sync</code> module fared better in the face of this expansion
    precisely because of it's modular design
    and well-considered data structures.
These decisions were informed by careful comparison
    of the various relevant options,
    and made use of modern, progressive technologies
    which lent themselves to the evolving environment of a full-stack application.
