#+TITLE: Building the STOCKS Application

* Building the STOCKS Application
The process of building the STOCKS application began in 2020,
    with the development of the original server application.
This application,
    written in Javascript for the Node.js platform,
    presented a fairly conventional REST API
    for accessing a MongoDB backend.
Its successor,
    a full-stack application using modern Typescript
    and popular front- and back-end frameworks,
    is the product of nearly a month of concerted effort.
The video code review and narratives below
    discuss the state of the original project
    and the development process that led to the STOCKS application.

The Video Code Review focuses on the state of the original Javascript server,
    as it existed at the end of August, 2020.
** [[file:posts/stocks-server.org][Rewriting the STOCKS Server]]
The first step in building the new STOCKS application
    was to tackle reimplementing the server in Typescript.
This meant wholesale embrace of new techniques and tools
    and a more nuanced approach to data.

With the core API and data model complete,
    focus shifted outside the application for the first time.
Real-world markets shift and change by the minute,
    but developing a workable application within the limits of a student budget
    required compromises and creativity.
