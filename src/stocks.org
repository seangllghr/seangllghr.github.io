#+TITLE: Building the STOCKS Application

* Building the STOCKS Application
The process of building the STOCKS application began in 2020,
    with the development of the original server application.
This application,
    written in Javascript for the Node.js platform,
    presented a fairly conventional REST API
    for accessing a MongoDB backend.
Its successor,
    a full-stack application using modern Typescript
    and popular front- and back-end frameworks,
    is the product of nearly a month of concerted effort.
The video code review and narratives below
    discuss the state of the original project
    and the development process that led to the STOCKS application.
** Video Code Review
The [[file:posts/code-review.org][Video Code Review]] focuses on the state of the original Javascript server,
    as it existed at the end of August, 2020.
