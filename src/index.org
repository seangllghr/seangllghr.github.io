#+title: Sean Gallagher â€” Portfolio

* Hi! I'm Sean
I'm a full-stack developer
    with experience across a wide array of technologies
    and an unhealthy interest in obscure publishing technologies.
This portfolio presents a snapshot of what I can do.
While there are a number of projects I'm still polishing for inclusion,
    I think the content here provides a broad-stroke overview of my best work,
    and I'd love it if you'd take a look around.
** The STOCKS Application

The STOCKS Application is a full-stack web application
    with a minimal, retro look-and-feel
    built according to the latest industry standards.
You can find the whole project codebase,
    written in Typescript, HTML, and Sass,
    [[https://github.com/seangllghr/portfolio-stocksapp][here on GitHub]],
    and you can read more my development process [[file:stocks.org][here]].
