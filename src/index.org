#+title: Sean Gallagher — Portfolio

* Hi! I'm Sean
#+begin_export latex
The online version of this portfolio is available at
\href{https://seangllghr.github.io}{https://seangllghr.github.io}
#+end_export
I'm a full-stack developer
    with experience across a wide array of technologies
    and an unhealthy interest in [[file:build.org][obscure publishing technologies]].
This portfolio presents a snapshot of what I can do.
While there are a number of projects I'm still polishing for inclusion,
    I think the content here provides a broad-stroke overview of my best work,
    and I'd love it if you'd take a look around.
** The STOCKS Application

The STOCKS Application is a full-stack web application
    with a minimal, retro look-and-feel
    built according to the latest industry standards.
You can find the whole project codebase,
    written in Typescript, HTML, and Sass,
    [[https://github.com/seangllghr/portfolio-stocksapp][here on GitHub]],
    and you can read more about my development process [[file:stocks.org][here]].
** InventoryApp

InventoryApp is an Android application written in Kotlin.
It's raw, rough, and unpolished,
    but it's a functional prototype of a complete application,
    and it was written in just two weeks—with
    no prior exposure to Kotlin
    and less than six weeks' total exposure to Android programming.
The project was one of the most intense experiences of my educational journey,
    and there is no stronger example
    of my ability to rapidly adapt to new platforms and technologies.
The full project codebase is [[https://github.com/seangllghr/portfolio-inventoryapp][preserved on GitHub]],
    and more screenshots and development details are available [[file:posts/inventoryapp.org][here]].
